            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Einstein’s most celebrated attack on the quantum theory led to the EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) thought experiment.</li>
            <li><strong>1950</strong> - He published an article on his theory in Scientific American, but because it neglected the still-mysterious strong force, it was necessarily incomplete.</li>
            <li><strong>1993</strong> - A Nobel Prize was awarded to the discoverers of gravitation waves, predicted by Einstein.</li>
